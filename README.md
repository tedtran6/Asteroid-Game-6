# Asteroid-Game-6
This is a collaborative Java game called Minerals and Momentum made with Kishan Thomala. The concept of the game is to collect minerals in space. The more minerals that you collect, the higher your score would increase. You collect these minerals by destroying asteroids in the map with your plasma balls. Each time that your ship shoots a plasma ball, it propels your ship in the opposite direction. This is used as your movement mechanic, rather than the traditional up down side or WASD keys. 

## notes
Sometimes the spaceship gets stuck in a corner or on an end of the map. This issue is solved by clicking multiple times on the ship, although it would be good to fix the game so that this wouldn't be necessary.
This project was a really interesting experimnent in playing with sprites and such. It was really fun creating the sprites as well, because it was an exercise in artistic creativity. 

below are some photos and a video of the game.
